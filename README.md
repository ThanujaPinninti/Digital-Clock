# Analog and Digital Clock

A visually appealing analog and digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project combines modern design aesthetics with dynamic functionality, making it an excellent addition to any portfolio or personal website.

## Features

- **Analog Clock**: Styled with a sleek and modern design, including:
  - Rotating hour, minute, and second hands.
  - Numbers arranged around the clock face.
- **Digital Clock**:
  - Displays current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format.
  - Blinking colon for a dynamic visual effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the clock looks great on all screen sizes.
- **CSS Glow Effects**: Adds a glowing aesthetic to the clock hands and digital clock.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for both analog and digital components.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for real-time updates of the clock hands and digital display.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/analog-digital-clock.git
   (https://github.com/ThanujaPinninti/Digital-Clock)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd analog-digital-clock
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the clock.

## Usage

- The analog clock displays the current time with rotating hands.
- The digital clock provides a real-time display of the current time in a clear and readable format.

## How It Works

1. **Analog Clock**:
   - CSS animations rotate the clock hands based on the current time.
   - `transform` property is used to adjust the rotation dynamically.
2. **Digital Clock**:
   - JavaScript `Date` object fetches the current time.
   - Time values are updated every second.
3. **Styling**:
   - Box shadows and gradients create a modern, embossed design.
   - Glow effects enhance the visual appeal.


## Customization

- Modify the colors or box shadows in the CSS file to match your preferred aesthetic.
- Adjust the clock size by changing the dimensions of the `.clock` and `.circle` elements.
